## 2 Risk factors
### Cancer genes
1. **Tumour suppressor genes**: A type of gene that makes a protein called a Tumor Suppressor Protein that helps control cell growth. Mutations (changes in DNA) in tumor suppressor genes may lead to cancer. **E.g. p53**
2. **Oncogenes**: A gene that is a mutated (changed) form of a gene involved in normal cell growth. Oncogenes may cause the growth of cancer cells. Mutations in genes that become oncogenes can be inherited or caused by being exposed to substances in the environment that cause cancer. **E.g. HER2**
3. **DNA repair genes**: A gene that codes for proteins whose normal function is to correct errors that arise when cells duplicate their DNA prior to cell division. **E.g. BRCA1 and BRCA2**

CONCORD Study 2018:
* 90% cancer cases contain somatic mutations
* 20% bear germline mutations that predispose an individual to cancer
* 10% show both somatic and germline mutations.
* => Somatic only: Inherited only: Both= 80: 10: 10

### (1) Genetic factor

* 5-10% of cancers
* Genes for classic family cancer syndromes
    * RB1 (retinoblastoma)
    * APC (familial polyposis)
    * MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 (Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer-HNPCC)
    * BRCA1&2 (breast cancer)
    * p53 (many cancers)

### (2) External factor

**A) Physical**

_*Radiation*_
Radiation of certain wavelengths, called ionizing radiation, has enough energy to damage DNA and cause cancer
* Radon
* High-energy radiation, such as x-rays, gamma rays, alpha particles, beta particles, and neutrons

*_Ultraviolet radiation_*
* Exposure to UV radiation causes early aging of the skin and skin damage that can lead to skin cancer
* The sun, sunlamps, and tanning booths all give off UV radiation

# Lec 4: Immunology
## 1 General concepts

*_Immunology_*
Immune system and its response to the invading pathogens and other harmful agents

**Pathogens** - capable of colonizing (infecting) humans and causing diseases
* Bacteria
* Viruses
* Parasites
* Fungi
* Prions
* Algae

**Harmful agents**
* Insect toxins
* Bites and stings from insects bees and spiders usually cause pain, swelling, redness, and itching at the site of the sting or bite.

*_Relative diseases_*

![](media/15931628119690.jpg)

*_Role of vaccination_*
1. Mimic the threat of an infectious _pathogens_ through stimulation of the **innate immunity**
2. Present distinct _antigens_ that can be recognized by cells of the **adaptive immune** system

### Organs and cells

**Peripheral lymphoid organs to promote adaptive immune responses**

* Lymph nodes
* Spleen
* Mucosal and cutaneous systems

![](media/15933127398683.jpg)
* Lymph node
![](media/15933142696864.jpg)
* Mucosal immune system
Plasma cells produce secreted lgA (slgA) who prevents microbes from generating 

*_Tissues to the number of lymphocytes_*

|  Tissue  |  Lymphocytes (million) |
| --- | --- |
|  Lymph nodes  |  190,000  |
|  Spleen  |  70,000  |
|  Bone marrow  |  50,000  |
|  Intestines  |  50,000  |
|  Lungs  |  30,000  |
|  Skin  |  20,000  |
|  Blood  |  10,000  |
|  Liver  |  10,000  |

**Cell types to function**

1. **Leukocytes** (neutrophils, macropohages and natural killer cells) **and lymphocytes** (T cells and B cells): Immune recognition
2. **Effector cells** (T cells and B cells) and molecules (complement proteins, enzymes and antibodies): Contain and eliminate infection
3. **Regulatory lymphocytes**: Immune regulation
4. **Memory lymphocytes**: Immunological memory
 
### Operation

*_How immune system functions_*
12h after infection: innate immunity; afterwards: adaptive immunity.
1. **Block** infections and eliminate extracellular microbes via non-specific innate immune system
2. **Cues** from the innate immune system inform the cells of the adaptive immune system as to whether it is appropriate to response and what type of response to make
3. Cells of the adaptive immune system **display specific recognition of foreign antigens** and mobilize potent mechanisms for elimination of microbes bearing such antigens
4. The immune system displays **memory** of its previous responses
5. **Tolerance** of self-antigens

## 2 Innate immunity
### (1) How to recognise

1. **PAMPs** (pathogen- associated molecular patterns): It recognizes _structures_ that are shared by various classes _of microbes_ and are _not present on normal_ host cells.
2. **DAMPS** (damaged-associated molecular patterns): It recognizes _molecules_ that are _released from damaged_ or necrotic host cells.

### (2) Receptors

![](media/15933180426683.jpg)
* **Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs)** – activate transcription factors that stimulate expression of genes encoding cytokines, enzymes, and other proteins

> TLR是单个的跨膜非催化性蛋白质，可以识别 _来源于微生物的具有保守结构的分子_ 。当微生物突破机体的物理屏障，如皮肤、粘膜等时，TLR可以识别它们并激活机体产生免疫细胞应答。
> 因此是连接非特异性免疫和特异性免疫的桥梁。

* **NOD-Like Receptors (NLRs)** – cytosolic receptors that sense DAMPs and PAMPs in the cytoplasm
* Other receptors - RIG-Like receptor, cytosolic DNA sensors (CDSs) and lectin receptors

### (3) Components

*_Principle components_*
* epithelial cells
* sentinel cells in tissues, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, neutrophil
* innate lymphoid cells, such as natural killer cells
* plasma proteins, including the proteins of the complement system

> * 上皮细胞
* 定点细胞，如巨噬细胞、树突状细胞、肥大细胞、中性粒细胞等
* 先天淋巴细胞，如自然杀伤细胞
* 血浆蛋白，包括补体系统的蛋白

*_Roles of different types_*
* **Epithelial barriers** – tightly adherent cells to provide physical and chemical barriers against infection
* **Phagocytes** – neutrophils and macrophages are blood cells that are recruited to sites of infection, where they recognize and ingest microbes for intracellular killing

![](media/15933201396425.jpg)

>     1. 微生物与吞噬细胞受体结合。
    2. 摄入吞噬体
    3. 与溶酶体融合
    4. 通过活性氧物种（ROS）、一氧化氮（NO）和酶来杀灭。

* **Macrophages** –  
    * produce cytokines that induce and regulate inflammation;
    * ingest and destroy microbes, clear dead tissues, initiate the process of tissue repair
* **Dendritic cells** – produce cytokines to initiate inflammation and stimulate adaptive immune responses
* **Mast cells** – bone marrow-derived cells with abundant cytoplasmic granules that are present in the skin and mucosal epithelium; activated by microbial products binding to TLRs.
* **Natural killer cells** – recognize infected and stressed cells and respond by killing these cells and by secreting the macrophage-activating cytokine IFN-γ

### (4) Complement system

A collection of circulating and membrane-associated proteins. Many are proteolytic enzymes.
> 概念：补体是存在于血清、组织液和细胞膜表面的一组经活化后具有酶活性的蛋白质。
一般性质：（1）主要由肝细胞和巨噬细胞产生。（2）大多为糖蛋白。（3）性质不稳定，容易被降解。（4）正常血清中各组分含量相差较大。

*_Activation of complement cascade_*
* **Classical pathway** – Antibodies that bind to microbes or other antigens (Adaptive immunity)
* **Lectin pathway** – carbohydrate-binding plasma protein, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), binds to terminal mannose residues on the surface glycoproteins of microbes. (Initiated by a microbial product in the absence of antibody – Innate immunity)
* **Alternative pathway** – some complement proteins are activated on microbial surfaces and cannot be controlled, due to the absence of complement regulatory proteins on microbes (only presence of host cells; innate immunity)

*_Functions_*
* Opsonisation and phagocytosis

> Opsonisation: Coating a microbe with molecules that are recognized by receptors on phagocytes
调理作用指抗体、补体与吞噬细胞表面结合，促进吞噬细胞吞噬细菌等颗粒性抗原的作用。

* Inflammation
* Cell lysis

> Forming a polymeric protein complex that inserts into the microbial cell membrane, disturbing the permeability barrier and causing either osmotic lysis or apoptosis of the microbe.
形成一种高分子蛋白复合物，插入微生物细胞膜，扰乱渗透性屏障，引起微生物的渗透性溶解或凋亡。

*_Cytokines, cell sources, cellular targets and biologic effects_*

![](media/15933356957277.jpg)
![](media/15933356957394.jpg)

### (5) Features i.e. Reactions
1. Inflammation – accumulation and activation of leukocytes and plasma proteins at sites of infection or tissue injury.
2. Antiviral defense – Natural killer (NK) cells kill virus-infected cells by cytokines (type I interferons), which block viral replication within host cells.

## 3 Adaptive immunity
### (1) Antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
* Dendritic cells
* Macrophages
* B lymphocytes

**Function**: Capturing and displaying of microbial antigens

Take dendritic cells for example:
1. Antigen captured by DCs
2. Activation of DCs
3. Migration of DCs
4. Maturation of migrating DCs
5. Mature DCs present antigen to naïve T cell

Maturation of DCs:
* Immature DCs express surface receptors that capture microbial antigens
* Mature DCs express high levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and costimulators for stimulating T cells

`Expression of, function...`

*_Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)_*
**Function**: displaying peptides derived from protein antigen

### Antigen recognition
Antibodies
Pathways


## 4 Disease diagnosis and therapy

### HIV – treatment
Drugs can be used to control the virus
1. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) – disable a protein needed by HIV
2. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) – faulty versions of building blocks
3. Protease inhibitors (PIs) – disable protease
4. Entry or fusion inhibitors – block the entry into CD4 cells
5. Integrase inhibitors – disable integrase, which is a protein that HIV uses to insert its genetic material into CD4 cells

> - 非核苷类逆转录酶抑制剂(NNRTIs)—使HIV所需的一种蛋白质失效。
- 核苷类逆转录酶抑制剂(NRTIs)—构建模块的错误版本。
- 蛋白酶抑制剂(PI)—禁用蛋白酶。
- 进入或融合抑制剂—阻断CD4细胞的进入。
- 整合酶抑制剂—使整合酶失效，整合酶是HIV用来将其遗传物质插入CD4细胞的一种蛋白质。

## 5 Case study

# Lec 5: Microfluidic devices for bioassay
## 1 Diagnosis

*_Survival rate_*

|  All  |  51%  |
| --- | --- |
|  Breast  |  85%  |
|  Bowel  |  54%  |
|  Lung  |  8%  |
Breast: detected in the early stage
1. Visualised, outside main body -> easy to identify. 
2. Not an organ for survival, outside main body -> can be removed.

### Noninvasive detections

*_Single protein molecule detection_*
To detect very low concentration of proteins in the fluid samples, the concentration can be below 10^(-15)M

* To detect frequently, must not be invasive.
* As noninvasive, can only get low concentration samples.
* To detect low concentration samples, must use high sensitivity technology.

General strategies to achieve high sensitivity
1. Target-based amplification (PCR)
2. Signal-based amplification (ELISA)

![](media/15935060688766.jpg)
> 1PM(拍米)=1×10^(15)m
1Gm(京米/吉米)=1×10^(9)m
1Mm(兆米)=1×10^(6)m
1km(千米)=1×10^(3)m
1dm(分米)=1×10^(-1)m
1cm(厘米)=1×10^(-2)m
1mm(毫米)=1×10^(-3)m
1dmm(丝米)=1×10^(-4)m
1cmm(忽米)=1×10^(-5)m
1μm(微米)=1×10^(-6)m
1nm(纳米)=1×10^(-9)m
1pm(皮米)=1×10^(-12)m
1fm(飞米)=1×10^(-15)m
1am(阿米)=1×10^(-18)m

### Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

1. 高温下（如95℃），模版DNA解旋
2. 温度降低时（如55℃），引物与模板DNA单链的特定互补部位相配对和结合
3. 温度回升时（如72℃），DNA聚合酶以目的基因为模板，将4种脱氧核糖核苷酸逐个按照碱基互补配对原则连接在引物之后，使合成的新链延伸，形成互补的DNA双链。

### Gel electrophoresis
For separation and analysis of macromolecules (DNA, RNA and proteins) and their fragments, based on their size and charge.

![](media/15935078123275.jpg)
*_To separate_*
* Nucleic acid: NA with negative electrode pass through the gel net under the electric field. Smaller, faster, further.
* Protein: to big to cross through the gel, thus separated according to the electrodes attached to the molecules.

### Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
Antibodies + colour change

* (1) Sandwich ELISA

![](media/15935118869010.jpg)
1. **Capture antibody** bound to a surface
2. **Antigen**-containing sample applied
3. **Specific antibody** added, bound to antigen
4. **Enzyme-linked secondary antibody** applied as detection antibody
5. **Chemical** is added to be converted by the enzyme into a colour/fluorescent/electrochemical signal

Not sensitive enough to detect most secreted biomarkers, for which the sensitivity needs to approach 10^(-15)M

*_To enhance sensitivity_*

![](media/15935123206048.jpg)
>  为了提高ELISA的灵敏度，我们开发了一种纳米颗粒法。首先在磁性颗粒上涂上抗体，以捕获目标蛋白，然后在磁性颗粒表面添加金厌氧颗粒，使其附着在目标蛋白上，从而显示出信号。然后再加入金颗粒，使其附着在磁性颗粒表面的靶蛋白上，从而显示出信号。一旦施加了磁场，磁性颗粒就会被聚集起来以增强信号。
