Mention that we concentrate on the limbs.
 
Background and key issues

1. Related tech, on which it is based on. E.g. bioelectric, …
2. Target audience
   1. Now who/where is using it?
   2. Why aren’t others using? Difficult
3. Difficulty: why wasn’t it invented before?
4. Similar tech, i.e. what was used before it came out? (Market)

Audience (diseases, countries). Involved tech (examples, stereotactic implantation,).

Bionic Limbs
[Market research](https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/bionics-market.html)

Segregated by types of tech into: 1. mechanical bionics 2. electrical bionics

Largest market: 1. limbs 2. heart

Bionic reconstruction: with myoelectric prostheses controlled by at least 2 electromyography (EMG) signals from remnant stump muscles 
<br>Prosthetic reconstruction: passive, body powered devices

Hand transplatation: biggest difficulty: immunity rejection (--> call for immuosuppression)

Myoelectric prostheses: receive control signals from 2 bipolar or tripolar EMG electrode assemblies placed in the prostheses’ shaft. These sensing modules are then placed onto the skin, superficial to remnant stump muscles, and control the device via muscle‐derived signals. This connection between man and machine is called pros-thetic interface

Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR)
